            <div class="intro">
                <p>Throughout my career, I've embraced every challenge as an opportunity to create impactful experiences — for users, businesses, and the teams I've had the privilege to lead. From running my own design studio in Italy to leading global digital transformations for iconic brands like Nespresso, Richemont, and Mews, my journey has been one of continuous learning, growth, and reinvention.</p>
                <p>I've scaled design teams across industries, built design systems that ensure consistency and scalability, and driven business outcomes through user-centered solutions. Along the way, I've learned to balance creativity with strategic thinking, ensuring that design efforts align with both user needs and business goals.</p>
                <p>This page captures my journey — from hands-on design work to strategic leadership roles — and highlights how I've helped brands deliver exceptional digital experiences while building high-performing teams that thrive on collaboration, innovation, and purpose.</p>

                        <p>At Mews, I lead product design with a vision to make hotel operations seamless and empowering for staff worldwide. As Product Design Director, I've spearheaded design innovation that directly improved hotel staff productivity, achieving a 34% increase in Net Promoter Score (NPS). I've rebuilt and scaled a high-performing design team of eight Senior Product Designers, focusing on performance management, collaboration, and remote-first culture.</p>
                        <p>This leadership approach has fostered strong engagement, reflected in an 85%+ team satisfaction score across the company. By driving strategic initiatives in operations and connectivity, my team and I have transformed the way hoteliers manage events and deliver exceptional guest experiences. Through aligning design efforts with business goals and user needs, we've consistently delivered meaningful and impactful outcomes that empower hotels to operate more efficiently while enhancing human experiences.</p>

                        <p>One of my key contributions was the development of a scalable white-label design system that streamlined market launches for over 10 luxury brands.

                        <p>Between 2008 and 2015, I founded and led Andrea Pilutti Design, a digital and print design studio based in Torino, Italy. Serving national clients such as UNICEF, BNP Paribas, and CITI Bank, I built a portfolio of impactful creative solutions across digital and direct-to-consumer (DTC) marketing projects. Beyond delivering exceptional design work, running my own studio taught me invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship, from client prospecting and business development to managing projects and scaling operations. I learned how to balance the creative and business sides of a design practice, developing a keen business acumen that continues to inform my approach as a designer today.</p>

As I grew in my career, I took on broader responsibilities, leading creative direction and managing partnerships with photographers, copywriters, and other creatives to bring campaigns to life.</p>
                        <p>These formative years gave me a deep appreciation for the power of collaboration and the importance of balancing creativity with strategic intent — lessons that continue to shape my approach to design leadership today.</p>
